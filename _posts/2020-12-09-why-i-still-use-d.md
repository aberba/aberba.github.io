There are so many programming language but only a few really appeal to the
majority of developers, hence their popularity (most used) and community size
explosion. Popular languages have more hands on deck hence their
[Accumulative Advantage](https://www.shortform.com/blog/accumulative-advantage/):
more developers -> more ideas -> more contributions -> more tools -> more
third-party packages -> more corporate support (because most of these developers
work for companies) -> more apps -> repeat. This very advantage gives birth to
many more advancement to the language and it's ecosystem. As more and more
people build their businesses and tools around the language, they are
incentivize to continuously invest their engineering resources and money to
improve the overall ecosystem. Think about it ðŸ¤”

> So what's my point in relation to D?

D is a unique but still familiar language. It has almost all the attributes
suited for a mainstream programming languages. It's statically typed but still
manages to be fluid and easy to write code in like any dynamically typed
language. It's got all the powerful features I've seen in any other language out
there, either comparably similar or better. Moreover, it's got some of the most
brilliant people behind it. This is why I've gone as far to write several
articles about why D is great for development including
[this one on OpenSource.com](https://opensource.com/article/17/5/d-open-source-software-development).

> So why isn't D mainstream?

So first of all you may ask, why is it even necessary to be mainstream or
"popular"? Isn't staying small and nimble how we can attract quality over
quantity?

I agree with this sentiment to an extent but the cost definitely outweighs the
benefit. Whe a larger community is well managed with clear roadmap and
communication of high-level goals, it can accomplish more. **Clear roadmap and
communication of high-level goals** ahh? Yep. That's one of the key missing
ingredients of the D community even as small and nimble as it is. Despite the
clever language design and seemingly promising direction, D lacks in the soft
side. This is what I believe holds the grow and adoption of the language back.

> Soft skills... the people and organizational things.

### A train with no destination

-   The roadmap of the D language is still very unclear and the project page on
    GitHib has not been updated for over a year. See
    https://github.com/dlang/dmd/projects
-   There's little to no communication of language objects and mobilization of
    the community to reach certain milestones. There's almost no organizational
    side to the
    [D Language Foundation](https://dlang.org/foundation/about.html).

> So why do I still use D?

-   D is technically the best out there for me. It's the only language that has
    a clean and familiar syntax.
-   It's very powerful and capable of solving any domain problem: web
    development, network applications, system development, scripting, gaming,
    etc. This is rare because almost every language out there is either suited
    for one thing or the other.
-   It's got a package system. Unless you've got infinite amount of time on a
    project, you'll need to use code others have written to solve similar
    problems you may have. D makes it easy to discover such packages from it's
    package repository. Almost all modern language have similar centralized
    package repositories.
-   A great community. D has gone one of the best communities I've ever seen.
    The community is very welcoming and helpful.
-   It keeps getting better. D has consistently improved over the years that
    I've been in the community. Yes, it moves at a slow pace but it doesn't
    invalidate the fact that things keep getting better.
-   It can be better. Comparatively, D heavily lacks in community organization,
    leadership communication, development tools, third-party packages,
    documentation, learning resources, onboarding experience and general
    ecosystem polish. These can make D unappealing for certain projects with the
    need for a matured ecosystem. However, this can be made better.

As this year comes to and end, I hope the D Language Foundation revisit past
mistakes and look for way to make things better.
