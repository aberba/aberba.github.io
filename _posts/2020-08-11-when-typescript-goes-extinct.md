So its TypeScript heh? 

As with every technology, there are pros and cons. So I'm not even going to hit on [TypeScript problems](https://everyday.codes/javascript/7-really-good-reasons-not-to-use-typescript/) today. Today is about the extinction of the tool. So let me ask you this question:

> ### If you picture the next 10yrs, do you find yourself still using TypeScript?

To help you look at ways to think about this question, let's look at a brief history of **C and C++** and how the relationship broke-up. But before then, notice that:

> TypeScript serves one main purpose now, to add SOME typing to JavaScript, a language that WAS AND IS STILL not designed with static typing as a goal.

So back to the C and C++ history. If you read the [Wikipedia page for C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B), it tells you how C++ came about. Originally developed to enhance the C language, C++ **later evolved** to a much high-level language unconstrained by the limited goal of C. And that's when the promising relationship started to fall apart. However, C **did not die** (at least completely) because it was already its own independent language **suited for specific use cases**. As it stands now, there are several [incompatibilities between C and C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatibility_of_C_and_C%2B%2B) and users can't use C code in C++ without modification. That's as far as I go with the C and C++ history.

If you get where I'm going, a similar situation is happening with TypeScript and [EcmaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript) i.e. JavaScript. Even though they are mostly compatible now, one should note that both are isolated efforts that don't exactly share on the same goals.

> So when will the compatibility break up?

Well already, you may start to see the cracks happening when certain JavaScript features and library implementations are hard to use with TypeScript. Now TypeScript, the language (?? 🤔️) ["that was supposed to bring clarity and readability to the codebase obscures it instead"](https://everyday.codes/javascript/7-really-good-reasons-not-to-use-typescript/).

> TypeScript was ahead but now it's struggling to keep up.

I couldn't have said it better other than a comment someone posted:

> I think Typescript had a reason to exist when it was created 2012. Nowadays, it is true that it offers fewer advantages, we deserve a better alternative but… it's a religion in hype.

I however hold the opinion that anything **beyond what TypeScript currently does** for you is a hype. But the question is:
