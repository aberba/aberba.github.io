![Back to blogging](/images/2020-welcome.png) 

So I'm back to writing on my bog, long story short.

I've recently been doing some freelancing and working on my personal SaaS project, [@NnipaApp](https://twitter.com/NnipaApp). More about that later. 

But what I've also been doing more recently is complaining in the D forum. So I've had this side project going on where I'm looking to help improve the D ecosystem resources and do some series of demos/tutorials on what can be done in D. However, it turns out my analysis and complaints (sort of critique) fuels a lot of other dormant complaints and that **might** have lead to this:

> Then there's the omnipresent negativity of a huge chunk of the community...  it's rough. I used to read the forums daily until I noticed that it stressed me a lot, made me feel angry and sad and that it wasn't the place I wanted to be. Now I mostly keep an eye on Announce. I have no idea how this can be fixed though so I'll leave it at that. I completely assume the irony of posting this here.

Now there's a lot going on in the D community, but this very statement made me feel very bad. So I regret for *in some way* fuelling that...and have decide to change course for the better. 

Now I'm back to writing more here, and doing more of what I should have been doing already. Write about D, NodeJs + React, demos/tutorials, etc. I plan to write D articles for OpenSource.com [like I did back in 2017](https://opensource.com/article/17/5/d-open-source-software-development) and also the [D official blog](https://dlang.org/blog).

 And I've got a lot coming!!
