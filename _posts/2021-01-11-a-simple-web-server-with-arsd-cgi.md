Frameworks for building web servers in the D programming language come with
different conventions and design choices. I previously wrote about using the
vibe.d web framework both in it's
[route-base style](https://aberba.com/2016/hello-world-app-with-the-vibe.d-web-framework/)
and declarative
[web interface](https://aberba.com/2018/using-vibe-d-web-interface/) style.
However there's another alternative, the
[CGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface) style, which the
[arsd CGI](http://dpldocs.info/experimental-docs/arsd.cgi.html) web framework
was designed with (kind of).

The interesting thing about using arsd for me is it's simplicity and how
lightweight it is. It's quite straightforward to get a web server up and running
with very few lines of code. Moreover, arsd by default comes with zero system
dependencies. It does not require you to install any system package to use
unlike vibe.d. This advantage makes arsd easy to run in any environment
especially when you do not have system access to install system dependencies
(cloud functions, PaaS, etc).

> Zero system dependencies!!

Now, I'm will be using the D package manager, dub, to run the server app. Create
a dub project by running `dub init arsd-cgi-demo` command from your command line
where `arsd-cgi-demo` is your project's name. Make sure to add
`arsd-official:cgi` when prompted to add a dependency as follows:

```sh
dub init arsd-cgi-demo
Package recipe format (sdl/json) [json]:
Name [arsd-cgi-demo]:
Description [A minimal D application.]:

```

> The D package manager called [dub](https://dub.pm/getting_started) to create
> and run the project. Dub comes bundled with the D compiler when installed.

So lets see an example ards server:

```d
import arsd.cgi;

void handler(Cgi cgi)
{
	cgi.setResponseContentType("text/html");

	switch (cgi.pathInfo)
	{
		case "/":
			cgi.write("Hello, World!");
			break;

			// other routes go here

		default:
			cgi.setResponseStatus("404 Not found");
			cgi.write("Requested page not found.");
			break;
	}
}

void main()
{
	RequestServer server;
	server.listeningPort = 9000;
	server.serve!handler;
}
```

That's all it takes. You first create a handler which takes a `Cgi` parameter
with all the facilities to handle both receiving an http request and sending a
response.

`cgi.pathInfo` is used to match the request route and response according. You
may also use `cgi.requestMethod` to match the request method which may be one of
`cgi.RequestMethod.GET`, `cgi.RequestMethod.POST`, `cgi.RequestMethod.PATCH` and
friends. The following code shows how you may do that in the `handler` function:

```d
void handler(Cgi cgi)
{
	cgi.setResponseContentType("text/html");

	switch (cgi.pathInfo)
	{
		case "/":
			if (cgi.requestMethod == cgi.RequestMethod.GET)
			{
				cgi.write("Hello from GET");
			}
			else
			{
				// you may also send 404. Whatever you want, ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

				cgi.write("Hello, I'm also here.");

			}
			break;

			// other routes go here

		default:
			cgi.setResponseStatus("404 Not found");
			cgi.write("Requested page not found.");
			break;
	}
}
```

You may also notice that the `cgi.setResponseStatus()` method for setting both a
response status code and text. The prefix, `404`, becomes the response code
whilst the text that follows, in this case `Not found`, then becomes the status
text. This is a convention used in certain aspects of arsd CGI. I will dive into
those aspects in another post later.

Now since arsd CGI is written in D, a language with very powerful
metaprogramming support, it is capable of abstracting things to minimize the
lines of code needed to implement certain functionalities. Let's see the same
example in an idiomatic D code:

```d
void handler(Cgi cgi)
{
    // the rest of the content goes here
}

GenericMain!handler;
```

That's it!. No need to manually initialize a request server or register a port
manually. Arsd takes care of generating the code needed to handle all of that
for you. Pretty need.

This is just a tease of what arsd CGI web framework can do. It also supports a
declarative style for handling requests with a URL
[dispatcher](http://dpldocs.info/experimental-docs/arsd.cgi.dispatcher.html). I
will write about that later.

Now it's not all rainbow and sunshine with arsd CGI. It does not support all the
features you might get **out of the box** with Vibe.d such a SSL cert
integration (you may use NGINX as a proxy to handle SSL). This might be good
thing or bad depending on what you are used to or your use case. As mentioned,
arsd CGI is just one module in a whole
[collection](http://dpldocs.info/experimental-docs/arsd.html). It's meant for
you to pick and choose additional modules based on your needs including packages
available in the [D package repository](https://code.dlang.org).
