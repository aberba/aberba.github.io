In this tutorial, I will share my impression of the vibe.d web framework which is built in the D programming language.

## Keywords
- [D](https://dlang.org) is a statically type general purpose programming language with a c-like syntax and awesome modern features that makes programming easy and fun. It is the most "beautiful" programming language I have seen. The D compiler is available for Linux, Windows, MacOS, etc.

- [Dub](http://code.dlang.org/getting_started) is a package manager and build tool for the D programming language. I will use dub to fetch the vibe.d package from the D packages registry at <https://code.dlang.org>.

- [Vibe.d](http://vibed.org) is web framework that take advantage of the native speed, the easy-to-understand syntax and high-level features of D like fibers. Vibe.d is to D what Node JS is to JavaScript (EcmaScript). Vibe.d is very fast.

> ## _"So why vibe.d?"_

The answer is in the speed benchmark below. ![Vibe.d vrs other web frameworks benchmark](/images/2016-08-20-vibe.d-benchmark-2013.png)

# Setting up your development environment

My working environment for this tutorial is Ubuntu Linux 14.04, but you can use Windows, MacOS, etc. as well by installing the D compiler and dub from <https://dlang.org/download.html>. Dub and the D compiler are available for Ubuntu version 16.04 and above in the software repository, so just run `sudo apt install dub`. Note that I will be using dub to build the app in the command-line :) Vibe.d on Linux requires some dependencies which you can install using `sudo apt install -y libssl-dev libevent-dev` on Debian based Linux Distributions or `sudo dnf install –y openssl-devel libevent-devel libcurl-devel` for Fedora based Linux distribution.

## Creating a vibe.d project using dub

To create a vibe.d project, run `dub init helloworld --type=vibe.d` in the command-line at the location where you want the project to be created. In my case it will be `/home/aberba/workspace/d/`

After running this command, dub will take you through a process where you provide information for customizing your project build system such as Project Name, dependencies, Author Name, etc. I will just enter a description and press ENTER to apply the default for the rest.

```sh
aberba@mx:~$ dub init helloworld --type=vibe.d

Package recipe format (sdl/json) [json]:

Name [helloworld]:

Description [A simple vibe.d server application.]: A simple web app

Author name [Lawrence Aberba]:

License [proprietary]:

Copyright string [Copyright © 2016, Lawrence Aberba]:

Add dependency (leave empty to skip) []:   

Successfully created an empty project in '/home/aberba/workspace/d/helloworld'.
Package sucessfully created in helloworld
```

After completing the process, dub will generate the template for a vibe.d project similar to what you see below;

```sh
aberba@mx:~/workspace/d/helloworld$ ls

dub.json  public  source  views
```

The `source` folder which currently contains `app.d` is where the source code will be placed, the `views` folder is where you place all your `diet` templates. [Diet](http://vibed.org/templates/diet). is the default template system for vibe.d and the syntax is similar to [Jade](http://jade-lang.com). The `public` folder is where all your CSS, JavaScript and images will be placed and served. When used, diet templates will also generate HTML files during code compilation and placed in the `public` folder. When you open the `dub.json` is your code editor, it will have content similar to this;

```json
{
    "authors": [
        "Lawrence Aberba"
    ],
    "description": "A simple vibe.d server application.",
    "name": "helloworld",
    "dependencies": {
        "vibe-d": "~>0.7.26"
    },
    "license": "proprietary",
    "copyright": "Copyright © 2016, Lawrence Aberba",
    "versions": [
        "VibeDefaultMain"
    ]
}
```

This is how the dub build system configured, similar to Node JS `package.json`. The `dependencies` section indicates the version of vibe.d, in my case version `0.7.26`. You can learn more about dub at <http://code.dlang.org/getting_started>. 

The source code is located in the `source` folder, where I currently have just an `app.d` file. `app.d` is the entry file for a vibe.d app. The code inside is like;

```d
import vibe.d;

shared static this()
{
    auto settings = new HTTPServerSettings;
    settings.port = 8080;
    settings.bindAddresses = ["::1", "127.0.0.1"];
    listenHTTP(settings, &hello);

    logInfo("Please open http://127.0.0.1:8080/ in your browser.");
}

void hello(HTTPServerRequest req, HTTPServerResponse res)
{
    res.writeBody("Hello, World!");
}
```

You first import the module for the vibe.d web framework using `import vide.d`. The D module import syntax is `import module_name` to import all modules, or `import module_name.sub_module` to import only a sub-module. In this code I am importing the sub-module `d`.

In a normal D program, you would write a `main()` function which will serve as the entry point of the program, but vibe.d does this behind the scene. All you have to do is to put the entry point code in a `shared static this()` function (module constructor). Next you configure the vibe.d port and IP address(es) settings using `HTTPServerSettings` class;

```d
auto settings = new HTTPServerSettings;
settings.port = 8080;
settings.bindAddresses = ["::1", "127.0.0.1"];
```

The `auto` keyword is a way to tell the compiler to detect (infer) the type of `settings` at compile-time, just like writing;

```d
HTTPServerSettings settings = new HTTPServerSettings
```

As you can see, it is much easy to write `auto` instead of the long version. We then assign the addresses `::1` and `127.0.0.1` and port `8080` (IPv4, IPv6 and domain names are all supported). The `listenHTTP()` function, which starts the server, takes `settings` and a pointer to the function which will handle incoming HTTP requests, in this case a pointer to `hello()`.

Now you can compile and run the project by running `dub` in the command line which will automatically fetch all the dependencies from the dub registry (so make sure you have Internet connection). The output on the command-line will look similar to this;

```sh
aberba@mx:~/workspace/d/helloworld$ dub

Performing "debug" build using dmd for x86.

```

Pretty neat! Now open your browser and enter `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` into the address bar.

## Routing requests and using Diet templates

In example example above, every request is handled by the `hello` function which always send back the text `Hello, World!`. Since we don't normally want to handle every request the same way in a normal web app, we will have to provide a way to handle different request. Using the `URLRouter` class in vibe.d is one way we can route request (GET, POST, etc) for cases where a user browses to `/`, `/users/12`, etc. `URLRouter` class provides a convenient way to assign functions handle different URLs. We will also utilize the vibe.d diet templates.

```d
import vibe.d;

shared static this()

    // We are now using URLRouter here
    auto router = new URLRouter;
    router.get("/", &index);

    auto settings = new HTTPServerSettings;
    settings.port = 8080;
    settings.bindAddresses = ["::1", "127.0.0.1"]

    // We now passing router to listenHTTP()
    listenHTTP(settings, router);
}

// I now renamed hello() to index() and changes the content
void index(HTTPServerRequest req, HTTPServerResponse res)
{
    res.render!("index.dt");
}
```

As you can see, the `URLRouter` class instance, `router`, registers an HTTP GET request with `router.get()` which receives a URL as first parameter and a pointer to the function to handle the request as the second parameter. I my case, I passed the pointer to `index()` which is a modifies version of `hello()` from the first demo. The `render()` method of `HTTPServerResponse res` is then used to render the a diet template, `index.dt`, which I created in the `views` folder. The `!` symbol is a way to specify compile-time arguments in D a.k.a. [templates](https://dlang.org/spec/template.html). Dub will take care of fetching and compiling diet templates from the `views` folder. Notice that the `listenHTTP()` function will now take `router` as the second argument (not a pointer like `&router`). The content of the `index.dt` file is as follows;

```jade
doctype html
html
    head
        title Vibe.d Demo app
    body
        h1 Hello, World!
        p Welcome to my awesome vibe.d app.
```

Diet template syntax is just like [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/). Aside the Doctype declaration, every other first word in a line is interpreted as an HTML tags. Parent tags are determined by their indentation level. You can check the diet template documentation at <http://vibed.org/templates/diet> for more information.

Now let's see how you can route request for a URL like `/users/3`, where `3` is the ID of a specific user. First we set a route for `/users/3` using `router` and assign a function which I named `user`. I will place the route right below `router.get("/", &index)`.

```d
...
router.get("/users/:id", &user);
```

We then create the `user` function.

```d
void user(HTTPServerRequest req, HTTPServerResponse res)
{
    auto user_id = req.params["id"];

    // Assuming you fetched user information from
    // a database, REST API, etc. using "user_id"
    string name = "John Doe";
    int age = 25;

    res.render!("user.dt", user_id, name, age);
}
```

As you can see from the code, URL queries are populated in `req.params` where we get access to ID using `req.params["id"]`. You can then fetch user information from a file, database, REST API, etc. Vibe.d has built-in drivers for Redis and Mongo DB. There are also vibe.d drivers for other databases in the dub registry. Assuming we fetched the data using `user_id`, we can now pass that information to the diet template in the `res.render()` method as arguments which will be evaluated during compilation of the diet templates.

We now have to create the `user.dt` template file which we will pass to the `res.render()` method.

```jade
doctype html
html
    head
        title User Profile Page
    body
        h1 User Profile
        p This is the profile of user with ID: #{user_id}

        ul
            li User Name: #{name}
            li Age: #{age}
```

In diet template, you can access the value a variable in D when passed to the `res.render()` method. Using the `#{ VARIABLE }` expression as seen in the `li` tags will output the value. Now when you re-run dub in the command-line and browse to <http://127.0.0.1:8080/users/3> in your browser you should see the generate page.

Sweet! Vibe.d is easy to use and straight forward. I recommend it if you want a web framework which is fast and scalable.
