> This tutorial assumes you have a basic knowledge in web development and knows basic programming. I recommend that you first read my previous post titled ["Hello world app with the vibe.d web framework"](https://aberba.github.io/2016/hello-world-app-with-the-vibe.d-web-framework/) if you are new to vibe.d web framework.  

In my previous post on [using vibe.d web framework](https://aberba.github.io/2016/hello-world-app-with-the-vibe.d-web-framework/), I showed how vibe.d can make web development easy. In this tutorial, I will show how you can use vibe.d to create a form to submit data and files.

Create a new vibe.d project. I will call mine `vibe-upload`;

```sh
aberba@mx:~/workspace/d/$ dub init vibe-upload --type=vibe.d
Package recipe format (sdl/json) [json]: 
Name [vibe-upload]: 
Description [A simple vibe.d server application.]: 
Author name [Lawrence Aberba]: 
License [proprietary]: 
Copyright string [Copyright Â© 2016, Lawrence Aberba]: 
Add dependency (leave empty to skip) []: 
Successfully created an empty project in '/home/aberba/workspace/d/'.
Package sucessfully created in vibe-upload
```

The contents of the project folder is as follows;

```sh
aberba@mx:~/workspace/d/vibe-upload$ ls 
dub.json  public  source  views
```

## Implementing form for text data
For starters, lets see how sending textual form data (text) works using HTTP POST. Create an `index.dt` file in `views` folder and insert the following [diet](http://vibed.org/templates/diet) template code;

```jade
doctype html
head
    title File upload
body
    form(method='post', action='/upload', enctype='multipart/form-data')
        p
            label(for='title') Title
            br
            input(name='title',type='text')
        p
        
        button(type='submit') Send
```

The contents of the `source/app.d` file will now be as follows;

```d
import vibe.d;

static this()
{
    auto router = new URLRouter;
    router.get("*", staticTemplate!"index.dt");

    auto settings = new HTTPServerSettings;
    settings.port = 8080;
    settings.bindAddresses = ["::1", "127.0.0.1"];
    listenHTTP(settings, router);

    logInfo("Server Running");
}
```

Unlike the previous vibe.d post, the `router.get()` HTTP route here uses the `staticTemplate` function to render `index.dt` as a static template for all GET requests (You can configure it however you want). 

Now its time to write a function to handle form submission using a POST request. Let's write an `upload` function above the `main` function and register it in `router` to handle form submission through `/upload` URL as specified in the form property (`action='/upload'`).

```d
void upload(HTTPServerRequest req, HTTPServerResponse res)
{
    import std.stdio;
    string title = req.form.get("title");

    writeln("Form title is: ", title);

    res.redirect("/");
}
```

The above `upload` function will extract the title input data from the `req.form` property using its `get` method (use `req.query.get()` method for an HTTP GET request). For now, we just write the title to the console and redirect to the browser back to the homepage. Run the server and fill-in the text input of the form which should look like the screenshot below;

## Implementing file upload
Now we are ready to add file upload functionality. Open the `index.dt` file and add a file input.

```jade
doctype html
head
    title File upload
body
    form(method='post', action='/upload', enctype='multipart/form-data')
        p
            label(for='title') Title
            br
            input(name='title',type='text')
        p

        p
            label(for='document') Select your document file
            br
            input(name='document', type='file')
        p

        br
        button(type='submit') Send
```

Create a new folder named `uploads` in your `public` folder where we will store all uploaded files. Now lets update the `upload` function to support file upload;

```d
void upload(HTTPServerRequest req, HTTPServerResponse res)
{
    import std.stdio;
    string title = req.form.get("title");

    // File upload here
    auto file = "document" in req.files;
    try {
        moveFile(file.tempPath, Path("./public/uploads") ~ file.filename);
        writeln("Uploaded successfully!");
    } catch (Exception e) {
        writeln("Exception thrown, trying copy");
        copyFile(file.tempPath, Path("./public/uploads") ~ file.filename);
    }

    writeln("Form title is: ", title);

    res.redirect("/");
}
```

In the above code, we use a try/catch block to handle exceptions in cases where moving file from the temporal folder to `public/uploads` fail (file permission restriction, etc). 

Now it's time to register the `upload` function to the `/upload` POST route in `router`. Add the following code below `router.get("*", staticTemplate!"index.dt");` to do that;

```d
router.post("/upload", &upload);
```

Now we are all set test our app. Build the project again and the form should now look like the screenshot below;

![Single file upload form](/images/form-upload2.png)


Fill-in the title input, select a sample file and submit form. If everything is successful, you should see the title input value printed in your command-line and the file should be uploaded to the `public/uploads` folder.

I hope you find this tutorial useful. In future tutorial, I will show how you can upload multiple files.
